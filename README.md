# Changes in the representation of women in jazz: A festival network study

In this master thesis, we will analyze the networks built from the Montreux Jazz Festival data. Two networks are built: The concert network and the musicians network. In the first, each node corresponds to a concert, and two concerts are linked if they have a musician in common. In the second, each musician corresponds to a node, and two musicians are linked if they have performed together. For both networks, we will analyze their parameters and topologies. In addition, we will examine different centralities in order to determine the most important musicians in these networks. Furthermore, we will construct and analyze meta-networks related to the music genres present at the festival. Next, we will investigate the size of the giant component of the two networks to determine which instruments had the greatest impact at the festival. Finally, we will study the changes in the representation of women at the festival, which is the main question this master thesis seeks to answer.
